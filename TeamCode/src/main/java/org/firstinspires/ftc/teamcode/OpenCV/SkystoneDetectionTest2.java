                 * if the reason you wish to stop the stream early is to switch use of the camera
                 * over to, say, Vuforia or TFOD, you will also need to call closeCameraDevice()
                 * (commented out below), because according to the Android Camera API documentation:
                 *         "Your application should only have one Camera object active at a time for
                 *          a particular hardware camera."

                 * NB: calling closeCameraDevice() will internally call stopStreaming() if applicable,
                 * but it doesn't hurt to call it anyway, if for no other reason than clarity.
                 *
                 * NB2: if you are stopping the camera stream to simply save some processing power
                 * (or battery power) for a short while when you do not need your vision pipeline,
                 * it is recommended to NOT call closeCameraDevice() as you will then need to re-open
                 * it the next time you wish to activate your vision pipeline, which can take a bit of
                 * time. Of course, this comment is irrelevant in light of the use case described in
                 * the above "important note".
